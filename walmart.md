# Walmart India: Customer Experience Insights & Innovations

## Module 1: Deep Feedback Mining

Analysis of Walmart India user feedback (social media, app reviews) reveals *recurring complaints* across categories.  Users repeatedly report **app performance and UI issues** (slow loading, crashes, awkward prompts), **checkout/logistics failures**, and **poor support**.  For example, many reviews note that the Best Price Flipkart Wholesale app is *“slow, buggy, and often crashes”*, with items **vanishing from cart or wishlist**.  Critical bugs include **login/OTP errors** (“Incorrect phone number” at login), **search malfunctions** (“hard to search” items), and **pricing/billing errors** (one customer was overcharged ₹602 with staff unable to fix it).  Delivery issues are common: shipments often arrive incomplete or late (“short delivery”, *expired* goods).  Refunds and returns lag – cancelled orders with no refund even after months – leading to dissatisfaction.  Long queues and unwieldy offline checkout (item scanning) also surface as pain points in forums.

**Key complaint categories:**

* **UX/UI:** App repeatedly asks for location/store selection; outdated app without features (no profile edit).
* **Performance:** Slow load times, frequent crashes.
* **Search & Navigation:** Poor search results; unintuitive interface.
* **Pricing & Billing:** Overcharging at checkout, missing price updates.
* **Logistics:** Delivery delays, missing or expired items, short shipments.
* **Checkout/Orders:** Failed transactions, canceled orders, tracking errors.
* **Customer Service:** Unresponsive support on refunds and complaints.

**Technical fixes (Java/Spring Boot):** We recommend microservices/APIs to address these issues. For example:

* **AuthService:** REST endpoints for login/OTP validation, backed by a `User` table (id, phone, OTP). This ensures robust login and fixes validation errors.
* **CartService:** Spring Boot API to add/remove items and retrieve carts. Database schema: `Cart(id, userId)`, `CartItem(cartId, productId, quantity)`. This preserves carts so items don’t “vanish”.
* **SearchService:** A search microservice (e.g. Java + Elasticsearch) with endpoints `GET /search?q={item}`. The DB schema would index products (id, name, category, tags) to improve discoverability and accuracy.
* **OrderService:** API to place orders, track status, and audit transactions. Schema: `Order(orderId, userId, status, totalAmount, createdAt)`, `OrderItem(orderId, productId, qty)`. Logging billing detail here helps catch pricing errors (e.g. audit scans vs. billed price).
* **ReturnService:** Handles returns/refunds. Tables: `Return(returnId, orderId, userId, status, reason)`, and refund records. This automates credit notes and ensures returns are tracked (avoiding the issue of missing credit notes).

Each service would be built with Spring Boot controllers (e.g. `CartController`, `AuthController`, etc.) and persisted via JPA/Hibernate.  Together these APIs + schemas address the top complaints by enforcing data integrity (e.g. cart persistence, accurate billing) and providing clear order/return workflows.

## Module 2: How to Increase Sales (Online + In-Store)

&#x20;*Image: AI-driven recommendation engine powering personalized cross-sells and upsells (conceptual).*

Indian customers are highly price- and deal-sensitive, especially during festivals.  To boost sales, Walmart India should combine value pricing with **personalization and urgency triggers**.  Research shows *personalized recommendations* significantly raise conversions and loyalty: shoppers *“expect tailored experiences”* and 71% get frustrated without personalization.  A Java/Redis/React personalization engine can implement this. For example, a Spring Boot microservice can use Redis (in-memory cache) to quickly fetch related products based on past purchases and browsing (as described in Redis tutorials).  A React frontend then displays “Recommended for you” and “Customers also bought” widgets in real time.   In practice, AI-based product recos have delivered *“incredible results”* by guiding users to more items.

Beyond personalization, create **FOMO/urgency** to drive immediate buys.  Limited-time **flash sales** (“Diwali Mega Sale for 2 days only”), countdown timers, and stock alerts motivate quick decisions.  Even small cues like banners saying *“Only 3 hours left!”* or *“Hurry – sale ends soon!”* have proven effective.  Similarly, targeted SMS/WhatsApp blasts or push notifications about flash deals or abandoned carts can recover sales (the Convertway report notes that WhatsApp campaigns with clear CTAs *“create urgency and drive instant conversions”*).

**Tech-powered growth examples:** Implement a **RecommendationService** (Java) with Redis cache and a React UI to suggest bundles or add-ons.  Build an **AlertsService** that triggers notifications when a limited stock item is viewed, creating urgency.  Use Redis to cache user preferences and shopping sessions, and React to render dynamic banners (“N people viewing this deal now”).  Integrate analytics in Java to identify trends (e.g. most viewed products) and adjust inventory/pricing dynamically.  According to industry cases, an AI-driven recommender not only boosts average order value but also repeat visits. Combined with festive bundles (buy X, get Y free) and FlashSale modules (endpoints for timed deals), these strategies should elevate both online and offline sales.

**Tech stack:** As a concrete plan, one could build a **Spring Boot Recommendation API** (e.g. `/recommendations?userId=123`) that queries Redis for cached user embeddings and returns product IDs (using vector similarity search as in Redis tutorials). The frontend (React) fetches these and displays them under product pages. Similarly, a **FlashSaleService** (Java+Redis) can manage time-limited offers, and push relevant updates via a React/PWA interface. Together, personalization + urgency tactics (supported by Java+Redis backend and React UI) can significantly drive up conversion rates and cart sizes.

## Module 3: Boost Customer Satisfaction

Hundreds of Walmart India app reviews reveal key friction points affecting loyalty. The biggest satisfiers are **reliability and convenience**.  For instance, customers expect *“fast shipping”* and real-time updates. Logistics research confirms this: 48% of shoppers say faster delivery is their top concern, and 95% want shipping issues resolved mid-transit.  Conversely, delayed shipments, hidden costs, or no tracking cause dissatisfaction.  In Walmart India’s case, users lament missing/expired items and lack of communication.  Returns also matter: industry data shows *“easy returns build loyalty and increase repeat purchases.”* A seamless return portal (with prepaid labels and quick credit) would directly improve trust.

To boost satisfaction, we propose backend features (Java microservices) such as:

* **DeliveryTrackerService:** A REST API (e.g. `/trackOrder?orderId=123`) to provide live status. Backed by a DB of shipment updates, this fulfills the demand for visibility.  In practice, this service could integrate with logistics partners and push SMS/App notifications as status changes.
* **ReturnsService:** As noted, a transparent returns workflow is crucial. A Spring service would manage return requests and refund processing. Schema: `Return(id, orderId, status, reason)` and `Refund(id, orderId, amount)`. Automation here reduces manual errors and speeds refunds, addressing complaints about “closed” or stalled return cases.
* **LoyaltyService:** Implement a points/vouchers system (akin to SuperCoins) so purchases earn rewards. Backend tables (e.g. `Points(userId, points)` and `Reward(id, userId, type, expiry)`) track and apply loyalty credits. This encourages repeat buying (customers “love” cashback and exclusive deals).
* **SupportChatbotService:** An AI-powered chatbot (possibly on WhatsApp/website) using Java with an NLP library (or external ML API) can answer common queries (order status, return policy) instantly. Quick resolution is key: studies show customers 2.4× more likely to stay loyal if issues are resolved quickly.
* **PerformanceMonitoringService:** For operational excellence, implement logging and alerts (e.g. slow page loads or transaction failures) so engineers can fix issues before users complain.

Each of these is a Spring Boot microservice with database persistence (PostgreSQL or similar) and clear REST endpoints.  For example, the DeliveryTrackerService might store each order’s courier updates in tables (`ShipmentUpdate(orderId, timestamp, location, status)`), exposed via `/order/{id}/status`.  Integrating these features would directly tackle the loyalty drivers identified by users: fast delivery and easy returns, combined with proactive support and rewards.

## Module 4: Ignored but High-Impact Bugs

Beyond common complaints, several **persistent bugs** continue unaddressed.  Notable examples from feedback include **cart persistence issues** (“all wishlisted and cart items get removed after every few days”), **search failures** (“specific results are hard to found”), and **login glitches** (“Unable to log in… Incorrect phone number”).  Others: **pricing audits** (erroneous billing with no recourse) and **return mismanagement** (closed tickets without refunds).

To fix these, we suggest 5 lightweight Java microservices:

* **AuthService:** Improves login/registration. It validates phone numbers and OTPs correctly (fixing the “Incorrect phone number” bug). Endpoints: `/auth/login`, `/auth/verify`. Tables: `User(id, phone, name, ...)`.
* **CartService:** Prevents cart data loss. It stores cart items server-side (e.g. in Redis or SQL) and returns them on login. This solves the disappearing cart/wishlist issue. Endpoints: `/cart/add`, `/cart/list`, `/cart/clear`. Tables: `Cart(userId)` and `CartItem(cartId, productId, qty)`.
* **SearchService:** Provides robust search using Elasticsearch or Solr. The current app’s hard-search is replaced by a Spring service hitting a search index of products, greatly improving findability.
* **OrderService:** Centralizes order fulfillment logic. It would track orders and detect issues like partial shipments or cancellations. It also enforces correct billing by cross-checking scanned items against price rules in real-time, preventing overcharge bugs.
* **ReturnService:** (Separate from OrderService) This handles return requests and credits. By exposing `/returns/create` and `/returns/status`, it makes sure refunds are processed promptly. This directly addresses ignored complaints about stalled refunds.

Each microservice would be a Spring Boot app (e.g. `AuthController`, `CartController`, etc.) with appropriate DTOs and JPA entities.  For example, the CartService’s `CartItem` entity has fields `(id, cartId, productId, quantity)`.  Such modular fixes would eliminate the bugs that frustrate users but have flown under the radar, improving the overall user experience.

## Module 5: Innovation from Other Industries

Walmart India can leapfrog by adopting cutting-edge tech from fashion, grocery, logistics, and health sectors.  Promising feature ideas include:

* **Augmented Reality (AR) Shopping:**  Fashion retailers use AR for virtual try-ons. Walmart’s own global tech has rolled out **“Be Your Own Model”** AR experiences.  Flipkart could similarly let merchants create AR previews of clothing or home goods. *Implementation:* A Java backend (Spring) serving AR assets, combined with mobile clients using ARCore (Android) or ARKit (iOS). Integrate ML (e.g. TensorFlow) for body/face tracking so users can “try on” apparel or glasses. Backend services in Java would supply 3D models (e.g. sandals, furniture) and textures.
* **Conversational/Voice Commerce:**  Voice assistants are transforming retail. Walmart’s tech team built voice/text shopping bots to *“enhance how customers interact”*.  India’s customers (e.g. rural markets) might prefer voice UI. *Implementation:* A Java-based NLP microservice (Spring Boot) using a library like OpenNLP or Dialogflow’s API to parse Hindi/English queries. Connect this to the product catalog so users can speak items (“add 2 kg rice”) to their carts. The frontend React app or WhatsApp chatbot can interface via API.
* **Smart Carts/Scan & Go:**  Borrowing from logistics, install IoT-enabled shopping carts or use the app to scan items as customers shop. This reduces checkout friction. *Implementation:* Java microservices to aggregate scanned item data in real time, coupled with backend inventory checks (e.g. using Redis for up-to-date stock levels). An ML component could predict the best path through the store or flag unpopular routes.
* **Blockchain Supply Chain:**  Grocery and food industries use blockchain for traceability (Farm to Plate solutions). Walmart could use a Java-based blockchain (e.g. Hyperledger Fabric with Java SDK) to immutably record each product’s origin, quality checks, and shipping steps. Customers scanning a QR code could see the entire journey of their produce.
* **AI Health/Wellness Features:**  Inspired by health tech, Walmart India could integrate simple health tools (e.g. a medicine reminder or teleconsultation link) for pharmacy purchases. A Java service could offer “virtual pharmacist” chat using ML, or analyze purchase patterns to recommend health tips (with privacy safeguards).

Each innovation would involve Java backend + ML or blockchain tech. For example, an AR feature might use a Java service to serve image data while ML (computer vision) runs on-device. A conversational bot would pair Java (Spring controllers) with an ML/NLP engine (like a BERT model for intent). These ideas combine cutting-edge tech with Walmart’s scale to enhance the shopping experience.

## Module 6: Real Build Project (3 Days) – *Persistent Cart Service*

**Chosen issue:** Cart items disappearing after delays (Module1).

**Backend Design (Spring Boot):**

* **Entities/DB:**

  * `Cart` table: `(cart_id PK, user_id FK, created_at)`.
  * `CartItem` table: `(item_id PK, cart_id FK, product_id FK, quantity, added_at)`.
* **Controllers:**

  * `CartController` with endpoints:

    * `POST /cart/items` – add an item (`userId`, `productId`, `quantity` in body).
    * `GET /cart` – get current cart for user (reads all CartItems).
    * `DELETE /cart/item/{itemId}` – remove one item.
    * `DELETE /cart` – clear cart.
  * Each endpoint calls a `CartService` (Java class) handling the logic.
* **Services/Logic:**

  * `CartService.addItem(userId, prodId, qty)`: Creates/updates the user’s Cart and CartItem entries. Uses repository to save to DB.
  * `CartService.getCart(userId)`: Fetches all CartItems for user’s cart.
  * Additional checks (max cart size, stock validation) could be added.

**Frontend Layout (React):**

* A simple **CartPage** component displaying a list of items (image, name, qty, price).
* Buttons: “+/-” to adjust quantity, “Remove” for each item.
* A checkout button at bottom.
* On loading, the page calls `GET /cart` and renders items.
* Adding products from catalog would call `POST /cart/items`.

**Folder/Git Structure:**

```

**Dockerization & Deployment:**

* **Backend Dockerfile:** Build JAR and run on OpenJDK image.
* **Frontend Dockerfile:** Build React (`npm build`) and serve static files (e.g. with nginx or `serve`).
* **docker-compose.yml:** Defines two services (`backend` and `frontend`), plus a Postgres database service.  On `docker-compose up`, containers spin up and connect.
* **Deployment:** Containers can be pushed to AWS ECR and deployed on ECS or Kubernetes. CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) would build images on commit.

**Elevator Pitch:**
*“Our solution implements a robust Cart microservice to eliminate the frustrating bug of disappearing carts. In three days, we outline a Spring Boot backend (with controllers and JPA-backed models) and a React UI. The API (`/cart`) securely saves every user’s cart state in a database, ensuring items never vanish. We containerize via Docker and use Compose for local dev, with future plans for Kubernetes deployment. This demo service not only fixes the high-impact cart bug but also provides a template for scaling the Walmart India app into a full microservices architecture.”*

## Module 7: Sentiment & Ops Dashboard

We propose a **React-based analytics dashboard** (with Spring Boot APIs) for managers to monitor customer sentiment and operations. Key features:

* **Complaints Trends:** A timeline chart (e.g. using Chart.js) of complaint volume by category (UX, delivery, returns, etc.) per week. This data comes from aggregating reviews/feedback tagged by our algorithms.
* **CSAT Scores:** Display of overall Customer Satisfaction (via survey or app ratings) with trend lines. A gauge or KPI box can show current CSAT.
* **Cart Metrics:** Visualization of average cart value, abandonment rate, and total active carts – integrating e-commerce data (e.g. calls from our CartService).
* **Sentiment Analysis:** We build a **SentimentAnalyzerService** (Java). It ingests textual reviews from Play Store/Trustpilot and uses an ML/NLP library (e.g. Stanford CoreNLP or a fine-tuned BERT model) to assign sentiment (positive/neutral/negative). The service stores sentiment scores in the DB. The React dashboard then fetches aggregated sentiment (e.g. % positive vs negative) and displays pie/bar charts.

**Architecture:** Spring Boot provides REST endpoints such as `/metrics/complaints`, `/metrics/sentiment`, `/metrics/csat`. For example, `GET /metrics/sentiment` returns JSON like `{ positive: 60%, neutral: 10%, negative: 30% }`. The React frontend calls these and updates D3 or Chart.js widgets. Behind the scenes, our Java services pull data from the complaint DB and apply a sentiment model to new reviews daily.

By visualizing customer feedback in real time, managers can quickly spot rising issues (e.g. a spike in “login problems”) and measure the impact of fixes. Including an embedded sentiment-analysis pipeline ensures even text comments feed into our operations. Over time, this dashboard turns unstructured feedback into actionable insights, enabling Walmart India to proactively improve the user experience.

**Sources:** All insights and user issues are drawn from real customer feedback and trusted sources: app reviews, industry research and technology case studies. Each technical recommendation aligns with what customers have reported, ensuring our solutions are grounded in their *actual* needs.
